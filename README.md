# Project 1: Navigation

### Introduction

In this project, an agent is trained to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

2. Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Instructions

The training and deployment of the agent is done in `Navigation.ipynb` 

The model of the agent is in `agent.py`

### Deep Learning Algorithm
The DQN was used for this project.

DQN model is built with 3 fully connected linear layers and Relu activation functions.

Hyperparameters:

- Replay buffer size = 100000
- Batch size = 64
- GAMMA (discount factor) = 0.99
- TAU (for soft update of target parameters) = 0.001
- Learning rate = 0.0005

This model was able to solve the environment in less than 550 episodes
